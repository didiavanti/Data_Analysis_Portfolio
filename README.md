### ðŸŒŸ About Me

My journey into data began with my own B2B startup, where I discovered my passion for digging into metrics to drive smarter decisions. Since then, Iâ€™ve helped teams optimize processes, track KPIs, and build executive dashboards that lead to real action.

I thrive on bridging the gap between complexity and clarity for C-level stakeholdersâ€”delivering insights through clean code, compelling visuals, and narrative storytelling.
