# üé≤ Gamescube: Uncovering Insights with Business Intelligence Dashboards

## üö© The Challenge

> *"How can we turn our data into decisions?"*

In 2017, **Gamescube**‚Äîa leading retailer of sports merchandise, apparel, technology, and recreational products‚Äîfound itself at a crossroads. Years of rapid growth had generated a massive trove of transactional and customer data. Yet, much of this goldmine sat unused, and strategic decisions became harder as sales plateaued, profit margins shrank, and customer loyalty waned.

Despite onboarding **15,000+ active buyers** and maintaining over **$10M in annual sales**, the company faced tough questions:
- Why was average spend per customer falling?
- Why did nearly 3 out of 4 customers never return?
- What hidden strengths and weaknesses lay buried in the product mix and regions?

## üí° My Approach

I was brought in to **transform raw data into a strategic asset**. My mission: design and deliver two interactive dashboards‚Äî**Sales** and **Customer**‚Äîthat would uncover patterns, highlight opportunities, and empower smarter decisions.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Landscape

- **Data Structure:**  
  Mapped the database (Orders, Customers, Geo Lookup, Order Status) with over **180,000 records**.
- **Initial Data Work:**  
  Performed rigorous quality checks and transformations using Excel.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Shaping the Story

I collaborated with executives and sales managers to identify key business questions:

- _How are sales and profits trending over time?_
- _Which product subcategories and regions drive growth or losses?_
- _How loyal are our customers, and who drives the most value?_
- _Where do we have the greatest opportunities for retention and growth?_

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Building the Dashboards

Using **Tableau**, I created two interactive dashboards:

#### üìä Sales Dashboard

Visualizes:
- Year-over-year and month-to-month sales, profits, order volumes
- Category and subcategory performance
- Regional comparisons

#### üë• Customer Dashboard

Highlights:

- Top performers and at-risk segments
- Geographic filters for targeted analysis

## üîç The Insights

The dashboards told a compelling story:

- **Stable but Declining Performance:**  
  2017 sales hit **$10.6M** (-4% YoY); profit fell to **$1.3M** (-6.5% YoY).

- **Customer Growth vs. Value:**  
  Customer base soared **+48%**, but average spend dropped **-35%** to **$700** per customer.

- **Retention Challenges:**  
  **71%** of customers placed only one order.

- **Concentrated Value:**  
  Top 10 customers delivered over **$11K in profit**.

- **Product & Regional Patterns:**  
  _Fan Shop_ led revenue, _Technology_ & _Outdoors_ excelled in profitability; other categories and regions lagged.

## üìà The Impact

With these insights, Gamescube‚Äôs leadership gained clarity‚Äîand a roadmap for action:

- **Customer Retention:**  
  Initiatives to convert one-time buyers into repeat customers.
- **Profit Margin Recovery:**  
  Deep dives into cost drivers and pricing.
- **Seasonality:**  
  Targeted strategies for weak months like December.
- **Product Mix Optimization:**  
  Focus on winners, re-evaluate underperformers.

The dashboards became central to Gamescube‚Äôs strategy sessions, driving conversations and tactical choices. This project demonstrated how **data storytelling** and visualization can unlock business potential.
