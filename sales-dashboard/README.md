# Gamescube: Uncovering Insights with Business Intelligence Dashboards

## The Challenge

In 2017, Gamescube—a dynamic retailer of sports merchandise, apparel, technology, and recreational products—faced a crossroads. After years of steady growth, the company was accumulating mountains of transactional and customer data, but much of it lay dormant, untapped for strategic decisions. Executives knew that to stay competitive, they needed to turn this data into actionable insights. 

Yet, the path was not straightforward. Sales had plateaued, margins were tightening, and customer loyalty was slipping. The company had just welcomed over 15,000 active buyers, but average spend per customer was declining, and nearly three-quarters of customers placed only one order. Gamescube needed answers to drive smarter growth.

## My Approach

I joined the project to transform data into a strategic asset. My mission: design and build two interactive business intelligence dashboards—one for Sales, one for Customers—that would reveal patterns, pinpoint opportunities, and empower the team to act.

### Step 1: Understanding the Landscape

I began by mapping the data structure: Orders, Customers, Geo Lookup, and Order Status tables—over 180,000 records in all. I explored quality, consistency, and relationships, using Excel for initial queries and checks. This groundwork was crucial to ensure the final dashboards would be trustworthy and robust.

### Step 2: Shaping the Story

Working closely with Gamescube’s leadership and sales teams, I identified five key business questions:
- How are sales and profits trending year over year?
- Which product subcategories drive revenue—and which lag behind?
- What are sales and profit doing over time based on average?
- What do customer loyalty and behavior look like?
- Who are our most valuable customers and how do we retain them?

### Step 3: Building the Dashboards

Using Tableau, I crafted two interactive dashboards:

**Sales Dashboard:**  
Visualized year-over-year and month-to-month sales, profits, and order volumes. Compared category and subcategory performance, spotlighting areas of strength and vulnerability.

**Customer Dashboard:**  
Segmented customers by order frequency, spend, and loyalty. Identified top performers and flagged at-risk groups. Enabled filtering by geography for targeted insights.

## The Insights

The dashboards told a compelling story:

- **Stable but declining performance:**  
  2017 sales reached $10.6M, down 4% from the previous year, with profit margins shrinking by 6.5%.

- **Customer growth vs. value:**  
  The customer base soared by nearly 50%, but average sales per customer dropped by over a third, to just $700.

- **Retention challenges:**  
  71% of customers placed only one order; few came back for more.

- **Concentrated value:**  
  The top 10 customers alone accounted for over $11,000 in profit, with individual contributions ranging up to $1,252.

- **Product and regional patterns:**  
  Fan Shop led sales, while Technology and Outdoors excelled in profitability. Certain regions and categories lagged, revealing clear opportunities for improvement.

## The Impact

With these insights, Gamescube’s leadership gained clarity—and a roadmap for action:

- Focus on converting one-time buyers into repeat customers.
- Investigate the drivers of profit margin decline.
- Target product and regional strategies to address weaknesses.
- Leverage top-performing categories and customers for growth.

The dashboards became a part of Gamescube’s strategic toolkit, driving conversations and decisions. Most importantly, the project proved how data, when brought to life, could guide a business toward sustainable success.
